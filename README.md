# ReportSheet
I automated an examination report sheet for an actual school using Excel.
The excel file contains three sheets:

## 1. The Record Sheet-
 This contains dummy data of students' continuous assessment and examination records from different subjects
## 2. The Report Sheet-
 This contains the individual students termly summary statistics, behavioural acumen and the school principal's comments
 ## 3. The Comment Sheet-
  This contains the class behavioural assessment and comments as provided by the form tutor
  
  # Act Report.
  The report sheet is populated by the data from the two other sheets using Vlookup, I also performed some summary statistics on the students' scores using basic excel formulas.
